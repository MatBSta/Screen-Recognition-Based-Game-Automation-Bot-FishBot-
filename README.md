# Screen-Recognition-Based-Game-Automation-Bot-FishBot-
The project showcases a bot that automates selected in-game actions, including screen element detection, mouse interactions, and handling multiple processes using multithreading. It leverages libraries such as PyAutoGUI, pydirectinput, and threading to simulate user input and react to detected events on the screen. This project demonstrates skills in automation, basic computer vision, and concurrent programming.
